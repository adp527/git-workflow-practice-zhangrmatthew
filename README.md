## Article Summary
This article talks about how a **ransomware attack** rendered a lot of technology
at a hospital to be unusable. As a result, a baby suffered a preventable issue
at childbirth due to lack of monitoring of signals, which the baby later died
from. The parent is now suing the hospital, and if successful, this would be
the first confirmed death from ransomware. This highlights the increasing
importance that **cybersecurity** has on our daily lives.
